## Valid Sources

Roughly speaking, a source is considered valid if - it could be used by a development team or beginner today on a new Passport project and not lead them astray.

An item is NOT valid if:

- It is an archived GitHub (or other) repository
- It is an outed project that is no longer actively maintained AND it's the type of project that requires maintenance.

An item can still be VALID if:

- It is a heavily used project/article (npm downloads being one metric)
- It is a heavily referenced project/article

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
